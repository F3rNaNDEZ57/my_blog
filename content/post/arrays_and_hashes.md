# Introduction to Backend Development and Flask



Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that simplifies the process of building web applications. Developed by Armin Ronacher, Flask is known for its simplicity and extensibility, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

Key features of Flask include:

- **Microframework:** Flask is a microframework, meaning it provides the essentials needed to build web applications without imposing rigid structures. Developers have the flexibility to choose and integrate additional components based on project requirements.

- **Routing:** Flask simplifies URL routing, allowing developers to define routes and associate them with specific functions easily.

- **Extensibility:** Flask follows the philosophy of being unopinionated and extensible. Developers can choose the tools and libraries that best fit their needs.

## Why Flask for Backend Development?

Flask is preferred for backend development for several reasons:

- **Simplicity:** Flask has a straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax, making it accessible for developers of all levels. This simplicity facilitates rapid development and reduces the learning curve.

- **Flexibility:** As a microframework, Flask allows developers to choose components based on project requirements. It doesn't impose unnecessary dependencies, giving developers the freedom to build applications tailored to their needs.

- **Active Community:** Flask has a vibrant and active community that contributes to its ecosystem. The availability of extensions and community support makes it easier to find solutions to common challenges.

## Setting up a Basic Flask Project

Now, let's get started with setting up a basic Flask project. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Flask:** Use the following command to install Flask using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

2. **Create a Flask App:** Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it. Then, create a file named `app.py`.

    ```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello, Flask!'
    ```

3. **Run the App:** In the terminal, run the Flask app with the following commands:

    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the message "Hello, Flask!".

Congratulations! You've set up a basic Flask project. In the upcoming articles, we'll explore more advanced topics related to Flask and backend development.
